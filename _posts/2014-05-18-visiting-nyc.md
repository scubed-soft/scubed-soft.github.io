From May 18 to July 14, I will be visiting New York City (and
a few other locations)!

During this period, I will be available for
some part-time work. If you're looking for some technical expertise,
particularly in Ruby on Rails, reach out to me at
<a href='mailto:hubert@scubedsoft.com'>hubert@scubedsoft.com</a>.
