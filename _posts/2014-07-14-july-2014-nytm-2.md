![Welcome to NYTM](/images/posts/2014-07-01-nytm.jpg)

In [part one]({% post_url 2014-07-04-july-2014-nytm-1 %})
of this series, I described the startups that presented in the first segment of
July's [New York Tech Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/ny-tech/):
[augmented reality for consumer products]({% post_url 2014-07-04-july-2014-nytm-1 %}#blippar),
[Google street view for retailers]({% post_url 2014-07-04-july-2014-nytm-1 %}#vosmap),
and
[co-worker personality rating]({% post_url 2014-07-04-july-2014-nytm-1 %}#knozen).
This post will discuss the three startups that presented in the second segment.

## [Shoppable](http://www.shoppable.com/){:id="shoppable"}

[72Lux](http://www.72lux.com/)
demonstrated Shoppable, what they described as a licensable marketplace.
The Shoppable platform provides a so-called universal checkout
API as well as a universal wishlist API intended for online publishers to
enable their readership to seamlessly purchase products from different retailers
directly on the publisher's website. For example,
[Time.com](http://time.com/) might publish an article about a new product from
[Sephora](http://www.sephora.com/).
Interested readers could then immediately purchase that product right from
the Time.com website. Alternatively, readers could also
save the product in their wishlist and later complete their purchase from
Time.com or any other publisher using the Shoppable API. Finally, consumers
could also visit the Shoppable website to purchase products directly from various
retailers.

### Q&A (paraphrased)

Is it possible to price compare against other e-commerce sites?
: Yes, but only with other websites that have integrated with the Shoppable
  platform.

How do you resolve conflicts (e.g. price differences) between competitors on your platform?
: It is ultimately a business decision for the retailers themselves.

## [Electric Objects](http://www.electricobjects.com/){:id="electricobjects"}

Electric Objects demonstrated their prototype of a digital "photoframe"
integrated with their website, a platform for managing the content that appears
on the photoframe itself. The photoframe they demoed was a 23-inch IPS display
running a customized build of Android. Unlike traditional photoframes which
display only static images, their photoframe can render animations as well.
Their intention in building this technology
is to provide users with a way to experience the digital art found across the
internet in a real-world setting. They have also begun an artist-in-residence
program to produce artwork especially for their photoframe.

### Q&A (paraphrased)

How do you address the problem of copyrights?
: We consider the display of artwork with our technology to be within the
  bounds of fair use.

How much power does the monitor consume?
: No more than an incandescent lightbulb.

What kind of material is used for the photoframe's case?
: Currently it is plastic, but we will also provide an option for a wooden
  case.

## [Amicus](http://www.amicushq.com/post"){:id="amicus"}

Amicus presented a service that allows non-profits to raise awareness, funds,
and increase engagement amongst their supporters. This service allows users to
send physical postcards to their friends to encourage them to join the cause.
The postcards can be customized to include a personalized message from the sender
and different images provided by the non-profit. One unique aspect of the service
is that users need not enter the recipient's address: this information is gleaned
from correlating the recipient's Facebook profile with publicly-available sources
such as voter registration records.

### Q&A (paraphrased)

Is it possible for users to input an address for recipients?
: No. For now it is only possible to send postcards to recipients whose
  addresses are available. We found that allowing users to add addresses
  for recipients suffered from
  [decision fatigue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue)
  and would not ultimately send the postcard.

How do you ensure that the recipient's address is correct?
: We partner with data providers to ensure correctness of addresses.
