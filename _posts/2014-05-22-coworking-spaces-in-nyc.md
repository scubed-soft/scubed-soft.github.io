The other day, I visited several co-working spaces in New York City based on
[this article](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/08/17/the-5-coolest-coworking-spaces-in-new-york-city/)
(which I now realize is from 2011). Here's my take (ordered by my preference).

1. [New Work City](http://nwc.co/)

    **Likes**

    * Free equipment to borrow! Spare monitors + adapters and other electronic
      miscellany.
    * A good-sized, well-stocked kitchen
    * A couple "phone booth" rooms for phone calls. The rooms aren't very
      soundproof though.
    * Essentially no closing time. If you want to stay late, the staff can teach
      you how to lock up.

    **Dislikes**

    * Squeeky floors could be distracting. Can probably be mitigated with
      headphones
2. [Makeshift Society](http://makeshiftsociety.com/) (Bonus!)

    **Likes**

    * Huge windows with lots of natural lighting
    * Basement level with kitchen
    * Whiteboards have a wooden finish

    **Dislikes**

    * Located in Brooklyn (less convenient for me)
    * Large, open space can be loud/echoey
3. [Fueled Collective](http://fueled.com/coworking-space-nyc/)

    I wasn't able to get a tour per-se, but I did get to look around the
    space.

    **Likes**

    * Huge space with lovely decor
    * 24-hour access

    **Dislikes**

    * 3-month minimum
4. [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/)

    **Likes**

    * Wide open space and separate wings with cubicle like spaces
    * Electronic signs indicate when conference rooms are booked

    **Dislikes**

    * No longer a coworking space as of January 2014.
5. [WeWork Labs](http://www.wework.com/)

    WeWork has many locations around New York City offering private offices,
    dedicated desks, and hot desks. I finally scheduled a visit to their Soho
    offices and have been back for meetings a few times since.

    <del>
      They were short on staff when I visited, so were unable to give me a
      tour. I'll update this post when I get a chance to visit the
      space.
    </del>

    **Likes**

    * Large lounge area for hot desks
    * Private office section includes small lounges to take a break

    **Dislikes**

    * Office spaces can be a little small

6. [Projective Space](http://www.projectivenyc.com/)

    <del>
      No one was home to say hello, so I didn't get a chance to see the space.
      Perhaps another day.
    </del>

    **Likes**

    * Wide open spaces

    **Dislikes**

    * Can be quite noisy

### Final Thoughts
I really like the way these places keep the old interior of the buildings.
Sometimes the floors are a little squeeky, but it gives each place a unique
character that is just so hard to replicate.

Many of these coworking spaces don't seem to open on the
weekends. Perhaps that's just a hint to quit working and get out to have some
fun!

**Update 6/17/2014**: Added WeWork and Projective Space details
