  The other day, I attended July's
  %a(href="http://www.meetup.com/ny-tech/") New York Tech Meetup
  (NYTM). The meetup was split into several segments: two groups of three
  startups doing a short 3-minute demo of their products followed by Q&A, a
  "Hack of the Month" showcase, and finally three longer format demos. In this
  post, I talk about the startups that demoed their products in the first
  segment.

%p
  Blippar wowed the crowd in the first segment with their demonstration of an
  iOS-based
  %a(href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality") augmented reality
  app for consumer products. As with most augmented reality products, the app
  first scans a real-life object using the device's camera, then overlays
  computer-generated images on the screen in order to alter the real world as
  seen through the device. The presenter used an iPad to show the app rendering
  a 3D recipe book on the back of a ketchup bottle and also demoed trying out
  different colors of nail polish on a picture of her fingers as well. With the
  increasing pervasiveness of powerful mobile devices like the iPad, this could
  become an effective channel for brands to engage their customers. I believe
  their greatest challenge lies in increasing awareness about the technology and
  encouraging adoption amongst consumers.

%h3 Q&A (Questions and answers paraphrased)
%p
  %dl
    %dt How do consumers know which products to scan with Blippar?
    %dd
      We currently rely on product labeling, but hopefully soon you will be
      able to scan anything and everything.
    %dt
      Do you have any
      %a(href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software") OSS
      technology?
    %dd
      Our codebase is proprietary, but we provide the Blip Builder for
      third-party developers to use.

%h2
  %a(id="vosmap" href="http://www.vosmap.com/") Vosmap
%p
  Vosmap demoed their 3D virtual tour/interior mapping technology. They have
  partnered with Google to provide a Google Street View experience (officially
  known as Google Maps Business View) for retail outlets like restaurants, auto
  dealerships, and department stores. Vosmap does the actual work of taking
  panoramic photos, stitching them together, and then providing the media to
  Google.

%h3 Q&A (Questions and answers paraphrased)
%p
  %dl
    %dt How often do you update the photos?
    %dd
      It is up to the businesses to decide. Auto dealers, for example, tend to
      update more frequently to ensure they have photos of the latest models in
      the lot online.
    %dt
      How do you take the images?
    %dd
      DSLRs mounted on tripods.

%h2
  %a(id="knozen" href="https://www.knozen.com/") Knozen
%p
  Knozen demoed a co-worker personality rating app for iOS intended to be used
  in the workplace. Employees are presented with two of their colleagues to
  compare and a question such as "Who is more analytical?". Employees can rate
  their colleagues on a variety of different scales and can see their own
  personal ratings based on their colleagues' opinions.

%h3 Q&A (Questions and answers paraphrased)
%p
  %dl
    %dt
      Are the questions and personality analyses from this app based on any
      research?
    %dd
      We base our analyses on the work of
      %a(href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung") Carl Jung
      and others.
